# Personal Preferences

## Style

- Be concise.
- Don't add comments unless the logic is non-obvious.
- Don't add docstrings to code you didn't change.
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones.

## Workflow

- Read existing code before modifying it. Understand patterns already in use.
- Run tests after making changes when a test suite exists.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use subagents to keep main context clean.
- Use `/compact` proactively when context grows large.

## Code

- Follow existing conventions in the project — don't impose new patterns.
- Prefer small, focused changes over large refactors unless asked.
- Don't add error handling for scenarios that can't happen.
- Don't create abstractions for one-time operations.
